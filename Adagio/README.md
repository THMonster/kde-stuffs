## Installation

Put this folder into `$HOME/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/`.

And set the look-and-feel to `Adagio`

## Acknowledge

This look-and-feel is based KDE's official Breeze and highly inspired by SDDM theme [kde-plasma-chili](https://github.com/MarianArlt/kde-plasma-chili) and GNOME's new lockscreen(although it doesn't exist yet :P).

## About the name

I was listening to [Beethoven's Late String Quartets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_string_quartets_(Beethoven)) when I was conceiving a name for this look-and-feel. So I chose the [No.14(Opus.131)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_Quartet_No._14_(Beethoven))'s fisrt Movement, and took its tempo as the name of this look-and-feel. It is one of the most beautiful pieces over all compositions of String Quartet. As Richard Wagner said, it reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music.
